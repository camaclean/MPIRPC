 * Unmarshalling is a significantly greater challenge than marshalling. When marshalling,
 * the input is already in a valid constructed state.
 *
 * However, when unmarshalling there may be one or more different limitations of the types
 * which need to be handled. First of all, there is the issue of allocating memory. This
 * will often be different for local and remote unmarshalling, since local unmarshalling
 * will already have references or pointers to already-existing memory pass in as parameters.
 * Remote unmarshalling, on the other hand, often requires allocating memory.
